# Traffic Light in React

It's been 6 months since I started working professionally with Vue. Before that, I was learning React for employability reasons.

Now that I'm far along enough with Vue to feel fairly comfortable with it, I don't want to fall behind with React. So, here's a nice demo project. Idea shamelessly stolen from [@alexlee-dev](https://github.com/alexlee-dev).

**See this project live at [https://radtrafficlight.netlify.com/](https://radtrafficlight.netlify.com//)**

I am aware that the CSS background gradient is the worst code to ever exist. I don't know how to fix that and still keep it animated, though. If you have any suggestions, [open an issue!](https://github.com/rmorabia/traffic-light/issues/new)

## TODO:

* Add gif to README
* Somehow magically make the animation work in a less gross way
